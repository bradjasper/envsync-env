Envsync is a utility that helps keep your environments straight across
different computers

Its mostly for my own purposes, but if you find it useful all the better.


Todo
==========================================================================
 - Convert ENSYNC_ENV to be optional parameter to envsync.sh script


Features
==========================================================================
 - Easily install new scripts and dotfiles (dump them into src/scripts
    or src/dotfiles)
    - Also works with directories (for ~/.vim/ and similar)

 - Careful to not override or delete any existing files on install and
    uninstall

 - Easily define custom environments (ENVSYNC_ENV) and load scripts 
    based on OS type or custom ENV


Install
==========================================================================
 # Copy the following line into your .bashrc or .profile and re-login to
 # your shell
 . /path/to/envsync.sh ~/Projects/envsync/src --env macbookpro


Un-Install
==========================================================================
 # Remove the envsync line from your .bashrc or .profile
 . /path/to/envsync.sh ~/Projects/envsync/src --env macbookpro

 # If you've had any dotfiles synced, you'll also need to run
 # the uninstall script to remove the symlinks
 . /path/to/envsync.sh uninstall
